# RestaurantDapp

Copyright (C) 24/5/2020 George Ioannou. Anyone can use any feature from my Decentralized Application only after letting me know via e-mail (geoioan25@yahoo.com) and me responding back that it is okay to use.

I have created a simple Decentralized Application(Dapp) using solidity, python, javascript, Ganache and Metamask. Restaurants are able to create a competition via a web front-end and give Ether to a random future customer. Customers are able to join the competition by providing the Restaurant address, name, as well as hash message and signature as provided by the restaurant when the customer has visited. On expiration, a random winner from the competition automatically receives the Ether from the restaurant. 

## Prerequisites

In order to run & test the Dapp, Ganache is needed in order to get free test accounts with 100 Ether (https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache). Also, Metamask plugin in order to manage each account (https://metamask.io/download.html). Last, web3py is required in order to run the server (https://github.com/ethereum/web3.py). 

## Usage

For information on how to use the Dapp, examples and results of me running it, State and UML diagram, analysis on gas usage and security, what can be done to improve and how to run the tests, please take read the report I have written (https://github.com/GeoIoan98/RestaurantDapp/blob/master/Restaurant%20Dapp%20Report.pdf).

## Enquiries

For any questions about the Dapp, feel free to contact me on my e-mail (geoioan25@yahoo.com) by providing as subject "Restaurant Dapp".
