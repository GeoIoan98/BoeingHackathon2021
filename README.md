# BoeingHackathon2021
Team 30 - ΜΑΣΤΡΟΣ.coin

Our submission for the 24-hour CSSxBoeing Hackathon 2021 (20-21/03/2021).

We developed OceanCoin (OCN), an ERC-20 Token on the Ethereum Blockchain that
aims to solve the problem of ocean pollution by rewarding the organisations and
volunteers that clean the seas. The total supply of OCN equals the total kilos
of plastic that is currently in our oceans plus the projected amount that this
will increase over the next 10 years.

To help us achieve this goal, we will partner up with a number of environmental
organisations in different geographical regions. The tasks of these regional
organisations will be the registration of volunteers on our smart contract and the
validation of the amount of plastic collected by each after their expeditions.
The appropriate amount of tokens will then be "mint".
The volunteers that collect the garbage, will be the only suppliers of the OCN
token.

OceanCoin will also operate a digital action house for works or perks donated by
artists. This will be the principal source of value for the OCN token as users
that want to bid in our auctions will need to purchase tokens from any of the
volunteers that collected them. After every successful auction session, the tokens
that were used as payment will be burned and so the total number of tokens in
circulation will decrease (remember the same amount of plastic was already removed
from the ocean).

We believe that using the OCN tokens, will give financial support to volunteers
that work to solve the problem of plastic pollution in the ocean, motivate new
volunteers to work on this problem and lastly help with the adoption of crypto
in our society.
